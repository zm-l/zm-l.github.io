## My Internship

Around the end of March, I received an internship offer from IBM Malaysia. The internship period was 3 months which is May to August.

## Job Scope

My main task is to make a demo product on Red Hat Process Automation Manager (RHPAM) and document my self learning process.

I have created a walkthrough that is aimed at individuals who are new to RHPAM and want to gain some beginner knowledge. You can access the walkthrough [here](/rhpam/introduction).
