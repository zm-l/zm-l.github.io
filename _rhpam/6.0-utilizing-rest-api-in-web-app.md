To better explore the REST APIs, I figured to make a job portal website frontend and relies the JBPM server as the backend.

Please note that my approach to utilizing the JBPM server and a web app is purely experimental and may not adhere to established best practices or recommended guidelines. I cannot guarantee that the method I propose is correct or optimal. It is essential to consult official documentation and seek expert advice for proper implementation.
