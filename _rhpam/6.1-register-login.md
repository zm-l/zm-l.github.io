I would like to make a registration web page that could create a user in the Business Central via REST APIs. [These](https://stackoverflow.com/ questions/64914002/how-to-create-a-user-by-api-or-programmatically-in-jbpm-rhpam-bpmn-kie-server) are some APIs that can perform operation on users/groups. These APIs can be found in the RHPAM documentations.

However, I could not find API to authenticate the user and his password. So, I decided to create another backend server using Express and Postgresql to authenticate user when logging in.

### Backend Server

The backend server I wish to set up is simple. It only have a register and login endpoints.
