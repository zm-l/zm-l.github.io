Data objects are implemented as a Java class in jBPM. However, they are more like struct as it contains variables with different data types.

### Create a data object

3.  I will list the fields to be added in a table:

    | Identifier | Label               | Type      |
    | ---------- | ------------------- | --------- |
    | dob        | Date of Birth       | LocalDate |
    | email      | E-mail              | String    |
    | gender     | Gender              | String    |

    | name       | Name                | String    |
    | university | University          | String    |

4.  The candidate object should look like this.
