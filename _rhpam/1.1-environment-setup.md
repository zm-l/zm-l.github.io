To setup the environment, you can follow [this](https://timwuthenow.github.io/guided_exercises/00_get_tools/env-setup/) guide.

I will be listing some of the environments and tools I used below:

### 1 Linux Environment

I install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) through Microsoft Store. In particular, I used the Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS.

### 2 Git

You can install git [here](https://git-scm.com/).

### 3 Docker Desktop

You can install Docker Desktop [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

### 4 Kafka

Refer to the [link](https://timwuthenow.github.io/guided_exercises/00_get_tools/env-setup/#kafka) for more information regarding the Kafka setup. Below I will only copy paste the steps to follow:

1. Create a new folder named enablement and access it:

   > mkdir ~/enablement && cd ~/enablement

2. Clone this repository to your local machine.

   > git clone https://github.com/hguerrero/amq-examples

3. Access the amq-examples/strimzi-all-in-one/ folder:

   > cd amq-examples/strimzi-all-in-one/

4. Start the Kafka environment:
   > docker-compose up

Docker will download the images and start the services for you. You now have a Kafka server running on localhost port 9092.

You can also see a container named **_strimzi-all-in-one_** in the Docker Desktop.
