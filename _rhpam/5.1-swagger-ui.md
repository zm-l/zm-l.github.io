The Execution Server provides a rich RESTful API that allows user to interact with the process engine and deployed processes via a REST. This powerful feature allows users to create modern user interface and applications in their technology of choice (e.g. Entando DXP, ReactJS/Redux, AngularJS, etc.) and integrate these applications with the process engine to create modern, process driven, enterprise applications.<br/><br/>
The Swagger interface provides the description and documentation of the Execution Serverâ€™s RESTful API. At the same time, it allows the APIs to be called from the UI. This enables developers and users to quickly test, in this case, a deployed business process.

This exercise follows the Tim Wuthernow [guide](https://timwuthenow.github.io/guided_exercises/04_order_management/lab-walkthrough/#execute-the-process-via-apis) closely.

### Process Instance

1.  Navigate to the [KIE Server Swagger Page](http://localhost:8080/kie-server/docs/).

2.  Locate the Process instances section. The Process Instances API provides a vast array of operations to interact with the process engine.

3.  Locate the **POST** operation for the resource `/server/containers/{containerId}/processes/{processId}/instances`. This is the RESTful operation with which we can start a new process instance. Expand the operation:

    ![start-process-instance-rest-operation](../assets/images/business-central/swagger/start-process-instance-rest-operation.png)

4.  Click on the **Try it out** button.

    1. Set the **containerId** to `Job-Portal_1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`.

       The container id can be found in the **Execution Servers**.

       ![execution-server](../assets/images/business-central/swagger/execution-server.png)

    2. Set the processId to `Job-Portal.hiring`.

       ![process-id](../assets/images/business-central/swagger/process-id.png)

    3. Set Parameter content type to `application/json`.

5.  Set the body to:

    ```json
    {
        "candidate" : {
            "com.myspace.job_portal.Candidate" : {
                "dob" : "1999-12-30",
                "email" : "sam@gmail.com",
                "gender" : "male",
                "gpa": "3.9",
                "name": "Sam",
                "university": "um"
          }

        },
        "position": "sales"
    }

    ```

6.  Click on the Execute button.

7.  If requested, provide the username and password of your Business Central and KIE-Server user (in this example we have been using u: wbadmin, p:wbadmin).

8.  Inspect the response. Note that the operation returns the process instance id of the started process.

9.  Go back to the Business Central workbench. Go the process instances view and inspect the process instance we have just started.
