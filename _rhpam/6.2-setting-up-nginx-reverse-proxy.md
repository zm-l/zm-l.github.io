title: "Setting up Nginx Reverse Proxy"

Since our Business Central is hosted on `localhost:8080`, calling the REST API of the Business Central will be blocked due to CORS policy. To bypass this, I set up a reverse proxy to allow requests from any origin for simplicity sake (there are security risks involed).

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmH1L1QeNHk&ab_channel=CameronMcKenzie) is the guide I followed.

1. Run `sudo docker run -d --name nginx-base -p 80:80 nginx:latest`.

2. You will see a container named `nginx-base` is created in your Docker Desktop.

3. To make it easy to modify the configurations, run `sudo docker cp nginx-base:/etc/nginx/conf.d/ {path to your Desktop}}/default.conf` to copy to our Desktop. If you use WSL, it might be in `/mnt/c/Users/{your-username}/Desktop/default.conf`.

4. Check your jbpm-server id in Docker Desktop and run `docker inspect {jbpm-server id}  | grep IPAddress`.

   ![jbpm-server-id](../assets/images/business-central/docker/jbpm-server-id.png)

   You will see something as below:

   ![jbpm-server-grep-id](../assets/images/business-central/docker/jbpm-server-grep-id.png)

   Note the ip down.
