Disclaimer: This blog serves as a documentation of my learning journey rather than a comprehensive guide, as my knowledge on the subject is limited. Additionally, I have included some web development projects using Red Hat Process Automation Manager, which may not meet industry standards since I am not a professional web developer.

My experiments with the Red Hat Process Automation Manager follows closely to the [IBM Business Automation Open Edition 8.0 Enablement](https://timwuthenow.github.io/) by Tim Wuthenow.

Since I don't have subscriptions to IBM or Red Hat products, my focus is on showcasing the basic functionalities of RHPAM, which may not be applicable for real-world or corporate scenarios. In this walkthrough, I will only be utilizing free-of-charge platforms and methods.

The main purpose of this post is to provide a beginner-friendly walkthrough, making it easy for complete beginners to follow along. I will be using windows for the walkthrough.
