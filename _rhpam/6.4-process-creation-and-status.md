The processes are created from the `Apply` page. It allows `applicant` to key in their informations and the role in which they wish to apply to. After an applicant submit a form, it will call the JBPM server's API to start a new `hiring` process. Then, the applicant will be directed to the `Status` page and can see their application status.

### Apply

The [Apply](https://github.com/zm-l/rhpam-demo/blob/main/my-app/client/src/pages/Apply.tsx) component serves as a form for users to submit their application details.

It will then initiate a JBPM process using the `startProcess` function in the [jBPMClient](https://github.com/zm-l/rhpam-demo/blob/main/my-app/client/src/jBPMServer/jBPMClient.tsx) using the provided data.

It will also record down the `process_id` that the user invoked and store it in the database.

### Status

The [Status](https://github.com/zm-l/rhpam-demo/blob/main/my-app/client/src/pages/Status.tsx) component is responsible for displaying the current status of the user's application process.

It queries the `process_id` associated to the current user from the database.

Then, it communicates with the [jBPMClient](https://github.com/zm-l/rhpam-demo/blob/main/my-app/client/src/jBPMServer/jBPMClient.tsx) service to fetch the latest task of the `process_id`.
